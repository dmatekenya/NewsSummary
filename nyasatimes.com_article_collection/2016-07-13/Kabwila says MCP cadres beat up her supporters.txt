Kabwila says MCP cadres beat up her supporters

Malawi Congress Party (MCP) spokesperson Jessie Kabwila says the party cadres beat up her supporters at a rally in Salima over the weekend.



Kabwila: Sad 
“I do not want to speak much on the matter I can confirm that my supporters were indeed beaten up,” said Kabwila who is also the party’s shadow cabinet minister for Gender.
MCP president Lazarus Chakwera over the weekend held a political rally in Salima where some senior party officials were chased away.
The party cadres told Kabwila and her colleague Felix Jumbe to leave the podium but they were later allowed to attend.
However some Salima district party officials and a former regional chairman for the centre were chased away from the rally like criminals.
Jumbe in an interview confirmed he was told to leave but did not insisting he could not leave a rally of his party in his home district.
Chakwera confirmed there were problems in the party and was trying to find a lasting political solution.
He said in his life as a cleric and politician, he has faced huge challenges but God has always found solutions for him.
Kabwila and Jumbe now sit at the far back of the MCP bench in parliament from the front row reserved for senior party members.
