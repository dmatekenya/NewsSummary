Mchacha dismantles DPP structures in Kalindo constituency: MP kicked out of party

Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has finally kicked out “attention seeker” MP Bon Kalindo and has since dismantled all constituency political structures for Mulanje South constituency.



Mchacha: Kalindo has no control of DPP structure in his constituency
The decision to fire Kalindo comes barely 10 days after he was summoned to a disciplinary hearing.
DPP regional governor for the south Charles Mchacha confirmed that the party was replacing all political structures set up by Kalindo in Mulanje South.
“We are reorganising the party in the constituency because we discovered that they were set up without following party policy,” said Mchacha.
This literally means Kalindo has been kicked out of the DPP.  The MP resigned his post at deputy spokesman and as a members of the National Governing Council.
Mchacha said Kalindo will have nothing to do with the new constituency committee which he said will be set up soon.
Kalindo, a comedian-cum-politician, is accused of insurbodination after he organised a nude protest a few weeks ago to demonstrate against the barbaric killings of people with albinism.
DPP says he should have asked for permission from the party before urging Malawians to walk naked.
Kalindo said he is yet to receive communication on the matter.
He will however remain MP for his constituency until 2019 when the mandate of all legislators expire.
