Lucius Banda irks home fans after failing to perform

Followers of legendary musician Lucius Banda have expressed anger and disappointment with the artist after he failed  to turn up at a show organized over the weekend.
Lucius Banda: No show
Banda was supposed to perform at his Zembani Lodge in Balaka on Friday night together with his Band.
But the impressive patronage which had coughed K2,000 each to patronize the show was left frustrated after ‘Soldier’ as he is popularly known in the music circles was nowhere to be seen.
However, it was the Band leader Sam Simakweli who performed alongside Limbani Dube.



Nepman of the ‘Na Lero’ fame who has been performing with the band was also not present.
Following the development, several people who patronized the show have heavily critisized the artist through various social media platforms.
People who spoke to Nyasa Times also had no kind words for the self proclaimed soldier
of the poor.
“I love ‘Soldier’ and his music but what he did on Friday is uncalled for. That is day light robbery. If he knew he won’t come he couldn’t have been included on the adverts,” said a fan who identified himself as Christopher Sumaili.
Another resident of Andiamo area right in Balaka known as Joe Phiri said Banda acted like a crook.
“This behaviour is bad and an artist of Banda’s calibre is not supposed to act that way. If it was  in other countries, he could have been draged to court” said Phiri.
Another fun seeker who also works as a journalist with one of the well recognised media institution accused Lucious of the same.
“It has become a habit for Lucius and I remember it was again at Zembani during one of my visits where he was suposed to perform but he never showed up. We fun seekers need to be told the truth of who will perform and we decide whether to go or not” said one man.
Banda could not respond when contacted  through a messenger  Whtasapp.
