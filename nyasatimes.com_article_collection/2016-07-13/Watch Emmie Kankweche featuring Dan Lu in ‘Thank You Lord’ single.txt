Watch Emmie Kankweche featuring Dan Lu in ‘Thank You Lord’ single


Musician Emmie Kankweche who had gone quiet four years ago has resurfaced with a new offering titled “Thank You Lord”. The song features her man, celebrated afro pop singer, Dan Lu.
The singer released the new track with a video on June 9 under Dan Lu’s Rockers Records.



This is Emmie’s comeback into the music industry. We have recorded an album but because she has been out if the scene we will release a few singles before we launch the album,” disclosed Dan Lu in an interview.
The Blantyre-based singer-cum-business lady released her previous album “Ndaomboledwa” in 2012. This project had popular tracks such as “Palibe Ofananaye” and “Ndiwamoyo”.
In a separate interview, Emmie indicated she was now focused on reviving her music career under the guidance of Dan Lu.
“I was busy with business but now am free. I’m working with Dan Lu who is taking care of my music journey [and] that will help me concentrate,” she explained.
