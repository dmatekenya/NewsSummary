Speaking during the function, the MCP District Chairperson Emmanuel Nkhoma said the joining of Mwanyongo in the party symbolize that MCP is rejuvenating and becoming strong.
“It is difficult in Malawi’s political history to see  credible people joining and hundreds of people attending opposition party meetings  especially when organized at district level,” said Nkhoma.
Nkhoma related the development as the major sign that his party is liked by Malawians and that it is the only vehicle to take the country away from the economic turmoil.
“Recently  we welcomed renowned people like Dr Cornelius Mwalwanda (former deputy minister of Finance), the academician Dr Bellings Sikanda among others,” he added.



“Karonga now is the home of MCP and no go zone area for other parties,” Nkhoma disclosed.
In his remarks, Mwanyongo who is the owner of Inter-Line Bus Company as well as the former civil servant said:“I decide to join the party after noticing that it has the ability to save Malawian from hunger and economic crisis.”
“Apart from that, being the citizen of Karonga I am very concern with the failure of elected leaders to develop the North West constituency despite being the center or town of the district,” he added.
