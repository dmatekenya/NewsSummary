The Malawian musician who has recently returned from South Africa says he is working on new material some of which will be premiered on Saturday 9 July at Madsoc, an intimate little theatre in Area 2, Lilongwe.



“I would like to invite everyone to come experience the old songs like you’ve never heard them before and new unheard material from my much anticipated forthcoming EP,” he appealed.
Kalukusha has stood on many notable stages and platforms, to mention a few: BBC Introducing, TEDx Lilongwe, Lake of stars festival, Voice of America Radio (USA) and Bloomberg TV (Germany) and this august he will be performing in Scotland at the Edinburgh Fringe Festivals.
He is an artist who sings with an endearing honesty and earnestness that is rare, and refreshing.
Kalukusha has been studying Music performance at the famed African School of Film Studies and Live performance (AFDA) in Cape Town and promises an energetic yet eclectic show.
