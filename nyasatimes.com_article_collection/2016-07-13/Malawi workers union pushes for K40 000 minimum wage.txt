Malawi workers union pushes for K40 000 minimum wage

Malawi Congress of Trade Unions (MCTU) has asked the government to raise minimum wage to K40000 from K20000 due to escalating cost of living.
Workers need good pay
MCTU secretary general Pontiphar Kalichero said the union will soon be meeting government officials to discuss the matter.
“Statistics show that the cost of living is at K80000 to K100000 depending on which city and area one is,” said Kalichero
. Malawi is undergoing severe economic problems  following the  abrupt withdrawal of aid three years ago due to the plunder of public money at Capital Hill and severe weather patterns which led to flooding and drought among other factors.
Labour minister Henry Mussa said the government cannot push the minimum wage up because even companies have been hit hard by the economic spiral.
“If we raise the minimum wage, then two things might happen, either the companies will close down or the companies will make redundancies  which is not good,” he said.



He said the government do not want more closures of companies or redundancies as this will shake up further the dwindling economy.
Inflation and interest rates are high up forcing companies to down size their operations.
