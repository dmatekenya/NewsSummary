Tight race at top of TNM Super League table

At position 10, TNM Super League champions Nyasa Big Bullets have a tough task to defend their title as they are 11 points down against the current leaders Blue Eagles.
Silver campaign on track
Bullets have 16 points from 10 games played of four wins, four draws and two losses while the leaders Blue Eagles enjoy the summit with 25 points from 11 games of eight wins, one draw and two losses.
Coming second are Silver Strikers with 23 points from 11 games of seven wins, two draws and two losses while Mafco are third with 22 points from 12 games of six wins, four draws and two losses.
Mafco tie on 22 points with fellow soldiers Kamuzu Barracks, who have played more games at 14 in which they won six, drew four and also lost four.
The defending champions Bullets have found themselves in this awkward position after being on a three-week break when they contributed a bulk of their players for national duty during the Flames’ engagement in June for the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Zimbabwe and the Cosafa Cup in Namibia, where they were ousted after their three group qualifying games.
When they came back the other contenders had already gained ground.
Their arch rivals Mighty Be Forward Wanderers were also affected by the Flames’ engagements. They are on position nine with 17 points from 10 games of four wins, five draws and one loss.
