Parliament is expected to rise on Friday after a week long extension.
In addition, he said, Thursday will be government business day not private members day as is the tradition.
He said this will enable the government dispose off all remaining business.
Leader of the House George Chaponda said there are many bills which need to be tackled before parliament rises which include the Access to Information bill and several land bills among others.
The one week extension of parliament has cost the government unbudgetted K67.5 million in allowances for the 193 legislators who get a whopping K50000 per day each in addition to the K1.5 million basic salary.
