Reports from Home Grown African (HGA) camp indicate the release could be soon, however no actual dates have been given.
HGA has been silent since they released their critically acclaimed classic EP “Blantyre Blues” last year December. m.malawi-music.com/album.php?id=1
HGA manager Talumba Chirwa confirmed to this publication, saying: “We will be coming out of our half year hiatus soon”.
“We were in studio with Hyze last month actually.  We are working on something. Now we are waiting for Classick to arrive from Lilongwe so he can put his magic on it” explained TC.
It is quite exciting news because Engolah has been awfully quite this year not putting out anything.
Only Classick has stepped up to the mic with “Anaconda” and occasionally dropping verses on features for Sticky Stax and recently Gwamba.
In an earlier unpublished interview around March, we asked Engolah why he was starving fans.
He explained: “I am currently not recording music. But, as soon as am back in the studio. You’ll feel me. I am focusing on different aspects of the industry.”
He added: “Let’s just say my head is somewhere else at the moment. Not in the studio. My focus right now is to get us bankrolled for videos and other projects. Songs I can make any day.”
On a similar note, TC could not be drawn to comment on the videos but hinted we shall be promptly notified when all is ready.
