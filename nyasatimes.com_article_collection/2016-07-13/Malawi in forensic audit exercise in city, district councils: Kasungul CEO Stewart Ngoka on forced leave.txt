Malawi in forensic audit exercise in city, district councils: Kasungul CEO Stewart Ngoka on forced leave

Government says it has sent auditors to all city and district councils before releasing this year’s funding allocation.



Nankhumwa: Audit in councils
Finance minister Goodall Gondwe said councils which misappropriated last year’s funds will not get the allocation unless every penny is accounted for.
“We will prosecute all officers who embezzled the money,” said Gondwe.
Parliament approved huge sums of money for the district and city councils meant for grass root development.
Local government minister Kondwani Nankhumwa said the government would enforce all laws which protect public money.
In addition, he said there will be training for controlling officers of some councils to ensure that public money is protected.
Forced out
Meanwhile, Kasungu Town Council chief executive officer Stewart Ngoka has been forced to go on leave to pave way for government investigations following accusations of maladministration.
Workers downed tools demanding his removal after they had not been paid for three months.
Some councillors also accused the CEO of level headedness.
“He makes decisions without consulting anyone, this is why the workers have not been paid all that long,” said one of the councillors.
Mayor for the Municipality Irene Katola confirmed Ngoka is on forced leave.
“We will employ a temporary CEO as the government is making its decision on the matter,” she said.
She said a meeting of officals from the Local government ministry and councillors resolved to send Ngoka on forced leave.
In Chikhwawa, health workers have downed tools to force a chief accountant out of office. They are accusing him of disrespect to junior workers.
