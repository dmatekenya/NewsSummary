Our source reveals that the woman’s husband, Arnold Flao, has been asking his wife about her affair with Mwase but she  kept on denying the rumours.
Rita has been married to Flao for 12 years and they have three children while Mwase’s wife left her matrimonial home over her husband’s infidelity with Rita.
The source said when Rita knocked off from her work place at Lilongwe Department of Road Traffic and Safety, she jumped into a friend’s car heading to Mwase’s house.
“Flao was tipped that his wife was heading to Mwase’s house instead of their home at Area 18. He followed her and found her with Mwase in the house. Flao pummelled Mwase defacing him badly. And a chase ensued until Mwase’s car plunged into a ditch.
“The police picked them all but only detained Mwase and Rita, over night,” said the source.
According to the source, Flao has been trailing the wife for two years now and he was just waiting for concrete evidence which he has found.
Police said they are invetstigating the matter and questioning all parties before commenting.
