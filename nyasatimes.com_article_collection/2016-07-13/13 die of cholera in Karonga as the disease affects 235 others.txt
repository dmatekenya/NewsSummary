Lewis Tukula, a district environmental health officer said there are continued cases of cholera in some areas in the district because fishermen are not cooperating on hygiene practices.



“So far 13 people have died and we have treated 235 people mostly in camps where fishermen stay.
“The camps have no toilets and they use lake water for drinking. We have been engaging them to dig toilets, not to drink lake water and embrace hygiene practices but they are not cooperating,” he said.
Tukula said the district will be registering more cholera cases if the fishermen continue to disregard health advices.
The disease is under full control in Mangochi, Zomba and Nkhata Bay among other districts hit by cholera during the rainy season.
