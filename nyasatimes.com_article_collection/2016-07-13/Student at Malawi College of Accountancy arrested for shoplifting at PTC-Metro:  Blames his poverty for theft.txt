“He hid most of these items in his jacket he wore and he tried to get out of the shop without paying. The moment he was making his last steps out of the shop,  one of the workers noticed and attempted to stop him.
“The suspect tried to run away but was caught by police officers who rushed to the scene since the shop is just few meters away from Balaka police” explained Constable Sumaili .
He said the suspect was also found with a bag he had kept at a nearby place suspected to have again been stollen from one of the shops in Balaka.
The suspect straight away appeared before court where he confessed he indeed commited the crime.
He said he was tempted to steal since he is poor hence failure to purchase basic needs.
Owen hails from Chikwatu Village in the Area of Traditional Authority Mwambo in Zomba district.
