On Monday, the students Rahim Michael Sadik, Mathew Mbale, Wongani Lungu, Kike Nyirenda, Tamara Msachi and Tupochele Chatuwa were honoured in a prize presentation ceremony held at British Council office in Lilongwe.
Director of British Council in Malawi, Reena Johl, said she was proud that Mzuzu Academy has put Malawi on the map through their inspiring video.
“As the name of the competition, Your World, suggests, this was a global schools competition which allowed students to share with their colleagues around the world a picture of their lives. We are delighted that Mzuzu Academy won with their impressive and innovative entry that is mutually benefitting the school and community,” said Johl
Speaking on behalf of his colleagues after receiving the prizes, one of the students, Rahim Michael Sadik, said they were happy to be crowned regional winners of ‘Your World’ Competition.
“The feeling is unimaginable because the video which we produced, of teaching English and Mathematics to young boys and girls at Kwithu CBO, which is a way of giving back to community while helping us to reinforce what we learn in class, became a winning entry and we thank British Council for the opportunity,” said Sadik.



The students were handed beautiful framed pictures of themselves, branded t-shirts and two certificates each (one for participation and another as regional winners).
Your World Competition was an opportunity for students around the world to use their creativity and connect with each other while providing a window into their unique lives, environment and experiences. You can watch Mzuzu Academy’s winning video and other  on http://britishcouncilyw.vids.io
